# aurameter
this is a repository for anyone that wants to make an "aurameter" with an arduino uno

**Description**
this is a sketch i made on the arduino ide software for an arduino mega, wire up as shown on the wireup diagram picture in *main*. the purpose is satirical, and for mesuring the "aura" of somebody (actually just the distance) and then if you want to, make it go really high

**What sketch to use?**
Just use the sketch "aurameter" and upload it, in the future I might make more sketches with more features like leds, different sensors and so on

**Requirements and components**
You need any arduino with 4 digital pins and i2c support, that can also recieve code via the arduino ide (you obviously also need the ide downloaded from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/. for components you need 1 ultrasonic sensor, one capacitive touch sensor
(if you don't have one you can use a button aswell), one passive buzzer or piezo speaker and a 16x2 lcd with a i2c driver board
