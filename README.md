# aurameter
this is a repository for anyone that wants to make an "aurameter" with an arduino uno

**What sketch to use?**
Just use the sketch "aurameter" and upload it, in the future I might make more sketches with more features like leds, different sensors and so on

**What Arduino do I use?**
I used the arduino mega 2560, but you can use the arduino uno, nano and mega and still have everything connected to same pins, if you want to use a different arduino, then you might have to change the code. I will make more sketches for different arduino, but it is not hard to do yourself
