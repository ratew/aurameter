# aurameter
this is a repository for anyone that wants to make an "aurameter" with an arduino (in this case an arduino mega 2560)

**What sketch to use?**
Just use the sketch "aurameter" and upload it, in the future I might make more sketches with more features like leds, different sensors and so on
